    # Description
    The following description is a pseudo-formal specification/model of the NFT
    Application.
    
    The purpose of the NFT Application is to allow individuals called Authors to
    mint and sell the ownership of Digital Content (refered to as Artwork) to
    other individuals called Buyers. The Application allows the Author to
    maintainin part ownership of the Artwork via a pre-specified amount of
    shares. Upon the re-selling of the artwork the Author would receive an
    equivalent amount of money to the shares retained in the artwork.

    # Application Properties 
    
    The Application has the properties:
    
    1. A Buyer has a guarantees that the Author has listed the the Digital
    Content only once on the NFT Application, and that the Digital Content is
    not a counterfeit (has been produced by the Author).

    2. An Author listing the Artwork (minting an NFT) has a guarantee that the
    content cannot be forged by third parties on the application. Furthermore,
    the Author's shares, and Authorship claim cannot be changed, in subsequent
    resells. Finally that the Author, upon each subsequent re-selling receives,
    would receive their share of the winning Bid .

    3. A Seller has a guarantee of selling only to bids higher than the listed
    price, or of retaining the ownership of the Artwork indefinitely if is not
    for sell.

    The NFT Application opperates according to the following description: 

    The Application's Address hosts all the minted NFTs (tokens). Upon the
    selling or re-selling of an NFT, the token remains at the App Address; only
    the information attached to the token (the utxo's Datum) is changed. At any
    given point, all the correctly minted tokens are guaranteed to be consistent
    and correct.
    
    The implementation strategy adopted for the Application is done via the use
    of an Associative Linked List. Each list node holds a unique Artwork
    NFT. The list is sorted via the artwork's unique hash, with every Node
    (except the terminal node) pointing to the next node in the list. Each node
    points towards a node containing a larger 𝔸Token, with the Head of the list
    containing the smallest 𝔸Token - that of the empty string.

    # Minting 
    
    The Application's Minting Policy can verify both on-chain and off-chain if
    the minted NFT is unique.

    Minting a new token is the equivalent of creating an 𝔸Token that can be
    inserted in the Application's Linked List. The conditions in which this can
    happen are:

      1. There is an Application Head or Node containing a smaller 𝔸Token with a
      Terminal Pointer.

      2. There is an Application Head or Node containing a smaller 𝔸Token
      pointing towards a larger 𝔸Token than the 𝔸Token to be inserted.

    A Valid Transaction must:

      2. Update the ProofTk's pointer to point to the Minted 𝔸Token, and submit
      it to the Application Address.
